            <h2 style="color: white; border: none; padding: 0; margin-top: 0;">Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>The U.S. housing market continues to show mixed signals in early 2026. While inventory levels have increased significantly (+9.2% year-over-year), median home prices are experiencing a modest decline (-2.0% YoY) for the first time in several years. The mortgage environment remains dynamic with the Trump administration's proposed 50-year mortgage terms under consideration, potentially reshaping affordability calculations. Delinquency rates remain historically low, indicating continued borrower stability despite economic uncertainties.</p>

# Housing Market Intelligence Tracker

This repository hosts an automated weekly housing‑market intelligence report generated by a Zapier workflow. The report aggregates key U.S. housing indicators from authoritative public data sources and publishes them as a clean, readable HTML dashboard via GitHub Pages.

## What This Project Tracks
- Median home prices (Redfin Data Center)
- Inventory & supply conditions (Realtor.com Research)
- Foreclosure & delinquency trends (CFPB Mortgage Performance)
- Housing supply, vacancy, and construction activity (U.S. Census)
- Mortgage policy signals including emerging products (e.g., 50‑year mortgage proposals) and lending‑standard changes (AI‑summarized)

## How It Works
A scheduled Zapier automation runs weekly and performs the following:

1. Fetches updated datasets from Redfin, Realtor.com, CFPB, and Census APIs  
2. Performs an AI‑powered search for mortgage‑policy and lending‑environment updates  
3. Generates a structured HTML report using a custom prompt  
4. Publishes the report to this repository as `index.html`  
5. GitHub Pages serves the report publicly

## Purpose
This project provides a consistent, automated view of macro‑level housing conditions, helping analysts, researchers, and market observers track shifts in pricing, supply, demand, and mortgage policy with minimal manual effort.

## Live Report
Once GitHub Pages is enabled, the report will be available at:
